# Logistic Regression from Scratch Using Numpy

This project implements **Logistic Regression**, a crucial algorithm in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, specifically for **binary classification tasks**. The goal is to build the Logistic Regression model from scratch using only the **Numpy** library without any external machine learning frameworks. The project was carried out to fulfill the requirements for Artificial Intelligence(CT653) during the sixth semester of my undergraduate study.

## Project Overview

The focus of this project is on health informatics, where the Logistic Regression algorithm is applied to a dataset containing essential health information such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The primary objective is to determine whether an individual is afflicted with a health-related condition based on their **vital health parameters**.

## Key Features
- **Binary Classification:** Predict whether an individual has a disease based on health data.
- **Health Informatics:** Analyze critical health parameters like cholesterol levels and blood pressure.
- **Model Development:** From theory to implementation, the project walks through the development of a Logistic Regression model using Numpy.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained and evaluated using common metrics like **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.
- **Binary Crossentropy Loss:** The crossentropy function is used to measure the accuracy of predictions during the training phase.
